# Features

* Supports various image  augmentation techniques suitable for real environment conditions, such as adding noise, scaling, shifting, and more.
* Provides convenient integration with popular machine learning libraries such as **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **PyTorch**, etc.
* Allows augmentation of both images and their annotation files in formats such as XML, or TXT. (json will be added soon)
* Customizable augmentation parameters, including rotation angle, scaling factor, flipping direction, and more.

* Supports augmentation of multiple images and annotation files in batch mode.
